To make this project we try to follow up some steps:

1) First we choose JavaScript like our language program, then we used two libraries or packages to make easier our development.
    thats libraries are node_fecth and process (to be honest, we installed more than we need).

2) According with the documentation, we first consume the API ('https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com') to get the data.

3) Designed an index.js file, to act like an app, I mean we made it executable and pass the hight number like a parameter in the console. Thast why
    we used the process package.

4)After that we think in an algorithm that get the charactristics to be an O(log n), that is faster than O(N^2), and we choose the binary search    algorithm. 

5) But before implement the algorithm we first ordered the data and them use the algorithm. 

7) We use Linux like our OS. (Well this must be the first steps).;O)

To make this liltle app work first you have to download, in your machine whit OS Linux, you should have installed nodejs version 16.13.1, and install the packages mentioned above. A internet conection to consume the API and a desire to have fun.

Some pairs of players could be repeated, but is for the algorithm, thats due to data can appear in differents spaces during the search process.

I do my best, and thanks for the opportunity. I liked this proyect.
